Welcome to my GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am primarily a web developer and while web development is my main area of expertise, I occasionally explore prototyping in other domains to broaden my skill set and delve into new technologies. Currently, most of my public repositories showcase some of my web development projects/prototypes, but I aim to expand and share work from other areas as well.
In my free time, Iâ€™m deeply interested in artificial intelligence and its diverse applications. I am fascinated by how AI can transform user experiences and solve real-world problems.
