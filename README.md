Welcome to my GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am primarily a web developer and while web development is my main area of expertise, I occasionally explore prototyping in other domains to broaden my skill set and delve into new technologies. Currently, most of my public repositories showcase some of my web development proof of concepts, but I aim to expand and share work from other areas as well.

In my free time, I am deeply interested in artificial intelligence and its diverse applications. I am fascinated by how AI can transform user experiences and solve real-world problems.
